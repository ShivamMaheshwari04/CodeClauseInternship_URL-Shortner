# CodeClauseInternship_URL-Shortner

This is the Codeclause Internship Task Where I designed and developed a URL shortener using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I put my creative thinking to work and came up with a unique and practical solution. One of the cool features I added was an alert message that pops up when someone clicks the "Shorten" button without entering a link. This ensures that users are prompted to provide a link before proceeding. Additionally, I implemented another alert to handle cases where an invalid link or incorrect input is provided, guiding users to enter a valid link. Once the link is generated, users can conveniently copy it using the provided copy button.
